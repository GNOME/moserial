Build issues
============

A. moserial 3.0.x requires vala 0.12.x to compile.
   Early and later versions of vala will cause problems.
   Patches to fix compilation against later versions of
   vala are super-welcome!
   

B. If you see this error:
   src/SerialConnection.c:31:21: fatal error: stropts.h: No such file or directory

   then either:

   1. sudo touch /usr/include/stropts.h

   or

   2. patch your posix.vapi file as described at
   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=656690#c3

C. moserial does not implement the xmodem, ymodem, or zmodem protocols
   directly. It relies on the standard rz and sz utilities to send and
   receive data. These utilities, part of the lrzsz package, must be
   installed on your system.
