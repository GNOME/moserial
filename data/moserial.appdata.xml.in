      Moserial is a serial terminal used for interacting with serial consoles
      and embedded devices.
      It supports the view of incoming and outgoing data in both ASCII
      and hexadecimal formats with the option to log this data also.
      It also supports sending and receiving of x, y, and z-modem files, and has
      profiles to easily switch between configurations for different devices you
      are communicating with.
